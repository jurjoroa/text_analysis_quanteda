## Summary

This repository provides materials for a session that is part of the I2DS Tools for Data Science workshop run at the Hertie School, Berlin in November 2022. The student-run workshop is part of the course Introduction to Data Science taught by Simon Munzert at the Hertie School, Berlin, in Fall 2022.

### Session contents

 🎉 Welcome everyone to text analysis with quanteda 🎉

Have you ever wondered if analyzing what we read, write, say, and think is possible? Have you ever been curious to know if we can quantitatively measure and manage the speeches we hear, the movies we watch, or what we say to someone else? I have excellent news for you: it is possible and easier than you think. Quanteda is the answer to all your questions in this area.

This session will introduce you to the amazing quanteda world. Quanteda is the perfect package and a favorite for academia, researchers, and anyone who wants to do text mining and analysis with multiple text formats. Imagine, with this package; we can load .txt text files, word documents, and any other text format that can be read for further analysis. Quanteda is your best tool to generate word clouds, do statistics with words, and even be able to make inferences from your analyzed texts.

To teach you the main features of Quanteda and its potential, we will analyze a TV series; Yes, that's right: the television series How I Met Your Mother. We will discover principal characters; we will be able to know with whom they are related and even search for the most legendary phrases and the most useful words. Plus: we will do some sentiment analysis on the TV Show. Quanteda is fantastic, and our material will encourage you to enter the wonderful world of text analysis.
